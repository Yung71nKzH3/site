Elements
===

<h1> = heading (There a several amount of headings ranging from h1-h6 getting smaller)
<b> = bold text
<p> = paragraph
<tr> = table element
<li> = list element

<im src="img_boy.jpg"> An image tag used to display an image on a website
<em>This will create italic and special text really to emphasise something</em>
<strong>This is similar and will just make the text bold good for section headings</strong>
<a>An anchor used for hyperlinks</a> "<a href=https://www.com>Title for it</a>"
<img></img> = displays an image and by using an alt everytime is important same with widt and heigth all details being fulled

<ul></ul> unordered list 
<ol></ol> ordered list

<div> = dont mean anything just used for classing things and can be sued for CSS

What a website usually will look like layout wise

===

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
===

Colour Size Position

HTML defines how all these things can look like

How it looks

p = selector saying that all paragrapsh will respond to the fiven statement
color = as you guessed changes the color 

p {color:teal;} in this case all pragraphs will change the text color to teal

You can enter CSS either within the HTNK document or in its seperate file and link the two
How to link

<head>
<link ref= 'stylesheet' href="example.css" type= "text/css">
</head>

#myElement = id attribute

		body {font-size: 14px;}
		/* place your style rules below this comment */
		h1 {color: gold;}
		p {color: darkslategray;}
		em {font-size: 20px;}
		strong {font-size: 24px;}
		
		text-transform: uppercase;
		font-family: arial;
		color: rgb(0,0,0)
		font-size: (x)px;
